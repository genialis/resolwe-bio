      required: true
    - name: replicates
      label: Define Groups/Replicates
      type: list:basic:string
      required: true
      description: >
        Define sample groups and/or sample replicates. For example, a string 1 1 2 2 2 will split 5 samples into 2 groups with 2 and 3 replicate samples in each group, respectively.
    - name: labels
      label: Group labels
      type: list:basic:string
      required: true
      description: >
        Define labels for each sample group. For example, for samples split into 2 groups (e.g. 1 1 2 2 2), enter two group labels (e.g. group1 group2)
    - name: annotation
      label: Annotation (GTF/GFF3)
      type: data:annotation
      description: >
        A transcript annotation file produced by cufflinks, cuffcompare, or other source.
    - name: genome
      label: Run bias detection and correction algorithm
      type: data:genome:fasta
      required: false
      description: >
        Provide Cufflinks with a multifasta file (genome file) via this option to instruct it to run a bias detection and correction algorithm which can significantly improve accuracy of transcript abundance estimates.
    - name: multi_read_correct
      label: Do initial estimation procedure to more accurately weight reads with multiple genome mappings

      label: Analyze the provided samples as a time series
      type: basic:boolean
      required: false
      default: false
      description: >
        Instructs Cuffdiff to analyze the provided samples as a time series, rather than testing for differences between all pairs of samples. Samples should be provided in increasing time order at the command line (e.g first time point SAM, second timepoint SAM, etc.).

      type: basic:decimal
      required: true
      default: 0.05
      description: >
        The allowed false discovery rate. The default is 0.05.
    - name: library_type
      required: true
      label: Library type
      type: basic:string
      description: >
        In cases where Cufflinks cannot determine the platform and protocol used to generate input reads, you can supply this information manually, which will allow Cufflinks to infer source strand information with certain protocols. The available options are listed below. For paired-end data, we currently only support protocols where reads are point towards each other: fr-unstranded - Reads from the left-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) map to the transcript strand, and the right-most end maps to the opposite strand; fr-firststrand - Same as above except we enforce the rule that the right-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first sequenced (or only sequenced for single-end reads). Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated during first strand synthesis is sequenced; fr-secondstrand - Same as above except we enforce the rule that the left-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first sequenced (or only sequenced for single-end reads). Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated during second strand synthesis is sequenced.
      default: fr-unstranded
      choices:
        - label: fr-unstranded
          value: fr-unstranded
        - label: fr-firststrand
          value: fr-firststrand
        - label: fr-secondstrand
          value: fr-secondstrand
    - name: library_normalization
      required: true
      label: Library normalization method
      type: basic:string
      description: >
        You can control how library sizes (i.e. sequencing depths) are normalized in Cufflinks and Cuffdiff. Cuffdiff has several methods that require multiple libraries in order to work. Library normalization methods supported by Cufflinks work on one library at a time.
      default: geometric
      choices:
        - label: geometric
          value: geometric
        - label: classic-fpkm
          value: classic-fpkm
        - label: quartile
          value: quartile
    - name: dispersion_method
      required: true
      label: Dispersion method
      type: basic:string
      description: >
        Cuffdiff works by modeling the variance in fragment counts across replicates as a function of the mean fragment count across replicates. Strictly speaking, models a quantitity called dispersion - the variance present in a group of samples beyond what is expected from a simple Poisson model of RNA_Seq. You can control how Cuffdiff constructs its model of dispersion in locus fragment counts. Each condition that has replicates can receive its own model, or Cuffdiff can use a global model for all conditions. All of these policies are identical to those used by DESeq (Anders and Huber, Genome Biology, 2010).
      default: pooled
      choices:
        - label: pooled
          value: pooled
        - label: per-condition

      label: Use this many processor threads
      type: basic:integer
      default: 1
      description: >
        Use this many threads to align reads. The default is 1.
