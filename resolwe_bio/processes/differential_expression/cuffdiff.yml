    Cuffdiff finds significant changes in transcript expression, splicing, and
    promoter use.  You can use it to find differentially expressed genes and
    transcripts, as well as genes that are being differentially regulated at
    the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. See
    [here](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffdiff/) and
    [here](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/modules/docs/Cuffdiff/7)

    - name: annotation
      label: Annotation (GTF/GFF3)
      type: data:annotation
      description: |
        A transcript annotation file produced by cufflinks, cuffcompare, or other tool.
    - name: genome
      label: Run bias detection and correction algorithm
      type: data:genome:fasta
      required: false
      description: |
        Provide Cufflinks with a multifasta file (genome file) via this
        option to instruct it to run a bias detection and correction
        algorithm which can significantly improve accuracy of transcript
        abundance estimates.

      default: false
    - name: fdr
      label: Allowed FDR
      type: basic:decimal
      default: 0.05
      description: |
        The allowed false discovery rate. The default is 0.05.
    - name: library_type
      label: Library type
      type: basic:string
      description: |
        In cases where Cufflinks cannot determine the platform and
        protocol used to generate input reads, you can supply this
        information manually, which will allow Cufflinks to infer source
        strand information with certain protocols. The available options
        are listed below. For paired-end data, we currently only support
        protocols where reads are point towards each other:
        fr-unstranded - Reads from the left-most end of the fragment
        (in transcript coordinates) map to the transcript strand, and
        the right-most end maps to the opposite strand; fr-firststrand -
        Same as above except we enforce the rule that the right-most end
        of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first
        sequenced (or only sequenced for single-end reads).
        Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated
        during first strand synthesis is sequenced; fr-secondstrand -
        Same as above except we enforce the rule that the left-most end
        of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first
        sequenced (or only sequenced for single-end reads).
        Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated
        during second strand synthesis is sequenced.
      default: fr-unstranded
      choices:
        - label: fr-unstranded
          value: fr-unstranded
        - label: fr-firststrand
          value: fr-firststrand
        - label: fr-secondstrand
          value: fr-secondstrand
    - name: library_normalization
      label: Library normalization method
      type: basic:string
      description: |
        You can control how library sizes (i.e. sequencing depths) are
        normalized in Cufflinks and Cuffdiff. Cuffdiff has several
        methods that require multiple libraries in order to work.
        Library normalization methods supported by Cufflinks work on one
        library at a time.
      default: geometric
      choices:
        - label: geometric
          value: geometric
        - label: classic-fpkm
          value: classic-fpkm
        - label: quartile
          value: quartile
    - name: dispersion_method
      label: Dispersion method
      type: basic:string
      description: |
        Cuffdiff works by modeling the variance in fragment counts
        across replicates as a function of the mean fragment count
        across replicates. Strictly speaking, models a quantitity
        called dispersion - the variance present in a group of samples
        beyond what is expected from a simple Poisson model of RNA_Seq.
        You can control how Cuffdiff constructs its model of dispersion
        in locus fragment counts. Each condition that has replicates
        can receive its own model, or Cuffdiff can use a global model
        for all conditions. All of these policies are identical to those
        used by DESeq (Anders and Huber, Genome Biology, 2010).
