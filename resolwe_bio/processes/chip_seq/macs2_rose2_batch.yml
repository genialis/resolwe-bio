    This process runs MACS2 in batch mode. MACS2 analysis is triggered
    for pairs of samples as defined using treatment-background sample
    relations. If there are no sample relations defined, each sample is
    treated individually for the MACS analysis.

    Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS 2.0), is used to identify
    transcript factor binding sites. MACS 2.0 captures the influence of
    genome complexity to evaluate the significance of enriched ChIP
    regions, and MACS improves the spatial resolution of binding sites
    through combining the information of both sequencing tag position
    and orientation. It has also an option to link nearby peaks together
    in order to call broad peaks. See
    [here](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/) for more information.

    In addition to peak-calling, this process computes ChIP-Seq and
    ATAC-Seq QC metrics. Process returns a QC metrics report, fragment
    length estimation, and a deduplicated tagAlign file. QC report
    contains ENCODE 3 proposed QC metrics --
    [NRF](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/),
    [PBC bottlenecking coefficients, NSC, and RSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/qualityMetrics.html#chipSeq).

    For identification of super enhancers R2 uses the Rank Ordering of
    Super-Enhancers algorithm (ROSE2). This takes the peaks called by RSEG for
    acetylation and calculates the distances in-between to judge whether they
    can be considered super-enhancers. The ranked values can be plotted and by
    locating the inflection point in the resulting graph, super-enhancers can
    be assigned. It can also be used with the MACS calculated data. See
    [here](http://younglab.wi.mit.edu/super_enhancer_code.html) for more
    information.

            Slocal and llocal parameters control which two levels of regions will be checked
            around the peak regions to calculate the maximum lambda as local lambda. By default,
            MACS considers 1000 bp for small local region (--slocal), and 10000 bp for large local
            region (--llocal) which captures the bias from a long range effect like an open
            chromatin domain. You can tweak these according to your project. Remember that if the
            region is set too small, a sharp spike in the input data may kill the significant
            peak.

          description: |
            While '--nomodel' is set, MACS uses this parameter to extend reads in 5'->3' direction
            to fix-sized fragments. For example, if the size of binding region for your
            transcription factor is 200 bp, and you want to bypass the model building by MACS,
            this parameter can be set as 200. This option is only valid when --nomodel is set or
            when MACS fails to build model and --fix-bimodal is on.

          required: false
          description: |
            Note, this is NOT the legacy --shiftsize option which is replaced by --extsize! You
            can set an arbitrary shift in bp here. Please Use discretion while setting it other
            than default value (0). When --nomodel is set, MACS will use this value to move
            cutting ends (5') then apply --extsize from 5' to 3' direction to extend them to
            fragments. When this value is negative, ends will be moved toward 3'->5' direction,
            otherwise 5'->3' direction. Recommended to keep it as default 0 for ChIP-Seq datasets,
            or -1 * half of EXTSIZE together with --extsize option for detecting enriched cutting
            loci such as certain DNAseI-Seq datasets. Note, you can't set values other than 0 if
            format is BAMPE for paired-end data. Default is 0.

            this parameter as the sonication fragment size expected from wet experiment. The
            previous side effect on the peak detection process has been removed. So this parameter

            highly recommended to detect adjacent binding events. While used, the output subpeaks
