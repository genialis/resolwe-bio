          type: basic:string
          placeholder: '3.4e7'
          required: false
          description: >
            It's the mappable genome size or effective genome size which is defined as the genome size which can be sequenced. Because of the repetitive features on the chromsomes, the actual mappable genome size will be smaller than the original size, about 90% or 70% of the genome size -- 2.7e9 is recommended for UCSC human hg18 assembly and 3.4e7 is recommended for Dicty genome.
        - name: qvalue
          label: Q-value cutoff
          type: basic:decimal
          required: false
          description: >
            The qvalue (minimum FDR) cutoff to call significant regions. Default is 0.01. For broad marks, you can try 0.05 as cutoff. Q-values are calculated from p-values using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
        - name: pvalue
          label: P-value cutoff
          type: basic:decimal
          placeholder: '0.001'
          required: false
          description: >
            The pvalue cutoff. If -p is specified, MACS2 will use pvalue instead of qvalue.
        - name: mfold_lower
          label: MFOLD range (lower limit)
          type: basic:integer
          required: false
          description: >
            This parameter is used to select the regions within MFOLD range of high-confidence enrichment ratio against background to build model. The regions must be lower than upper limit, and higher than the lower limit of fold enrichment. DEFAULT:10,30 means using all regions not too low (>10) and not too high (<30) to build paired-peaks model. If MACS can not find more than 100 regions to build model, it will use the --extsize parameter to continue the peak detection ONLY if --fix-bimodal is set.
        - name: mfold_upper
          label: MFOLD range (upper limit)
          type: basic:integer
          required: false

        - name: slocal
          label: Small local region
          type: basic:integer
          placeholder: '2000'
          required: false
          description: >
            Slocal and llocal parameters control which two levels of regions will be checked around the peak regions to calculate the maximum lambda as local lambda. By default, MACS considers 1000bp for small local region(--slocal), and 10000bps for large local region(--llocal) which captures the bias from a long range effect like an open chromatin domain. You can tweak these according to your project. Remember that if the region is set too small, a sharp spike in the input data may kill the significant peak.
        - name: llocal
          label: Large local region
          type: basic:integer
          required: false

          placeholder: '100'
          required: false
          description: >
            While '--nomodel' is set, MACS uses this parameter to extend reads in 5'->3' direction to fix-sized fragments. For example, if the size of binding region for your transcription factor is 200 bp, and you want to bypass the model building by MACS, this parameter can be set as 200. This option is only valid when --nomodel is set or when MACS fails to build model and --fix-bimodal is on.
        - name: shift
          label: Shift
          type: basic:integer
          required: false
          description: >
            Note, this is NOT the legacy --shiftsize option which is replaced by --extsize! You can set an arbitrary shift in bp here. Please Use discretion while setting it other than default value (0). When --nomodel is set, MACS will use this value to move cutting ends (5') then apply --extsize from 5' to 3' direction to extend them to fragments. When this value is negative, ends will be moved toward 3'->5' direction, otherwise 5'->3' direction. Recommended to keep it as default 0 for ChIP-Seq datasets, or -1 * half of EXTSIZE together with --extsize option for detecting enriched cutting loci such as certain DNAseI-Seq datasets. Note, you can't set values other than 0 if format is BAMPE for paired-end data. Default is 0.
        - name: band_width
          label: Band width
          type: basic:integer
          placeholder: '200'
          required: false
          description: >
            The band width which is used to scan the genome ONLY for model building. You can set this parameter as the sonication fragment size expected from wet experiment. The previous side effect on the peak detection process has been removed. So this parameter only affects the model building.
        - name: nolambda
          label: Use backgroud lambda as local lambda
          type: basic:boolean
          default: false
          description: >
            With this flag on, MACS will use the background lambda as local lambda. This means MACS will not consider the local bias at peak candidate regions.
        - name: fix_bimodal
          label: Turn on the auto paired-peak model process
          type: basic:boolean
          default: false
          description: >
            Whether turn on the auto paired-peak model process. If it's set, when MACS failed to build paired model, it will use the nomodel settings, the '--extsize' parameter to extend each tags. If set, MACS will be terminated if paried-peak model is failed.
        - name: nomodel
          label: Bypass building the shifting model
          type: basic:boolean
          default: false
          description: >
            While on, MACS will bypass building the shifting model.
        - name: down_sample
          label: Down-sample
          type: basic:boolean
          default: false
          description: >
            When set, random sampling method will scale down the bigger sample. By default, MACS uses linear scaling. This option will make the results unstable and irreproducible since each time, random reads would be selected, especially the numbers (pileup, pvalue, qvalue) would change. Consider to use 'randsample' script before MACS2 runs instead.
        - name: bedgraph
          label: Save fragment pileup and control lambda
          type: basic:boolean
          default: true
          description: >
            If this flag is on, MACS will store the fragment pileup, control lambda, -log10pvalue and -log10qvalue scores in bedGraph files. The bedGraph files will be stored in current directory named NAME+'_treat_pileup.bdg' for treatment data, NAME+'_control_lambda.bdg' for local lambda values from control, NAME+'_treat_pvalue.bdg' for Poisson pvalue scores (in -log10(pvalue) form), and NAME+'_treat_qvalue.bdg' for q-value scores from Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli procedure.
        - name: call_summits
          label: Call summits
          type: basic:boolean
          description: >
            MACS will now reanalyze the shape of signal profile (p or q-score depending on cutoff setting) to deconvolve subpeaks within each peak called from general procedure. It's highly recommended to detect adjacent binding events. While used, the output subpeaks of a big peak region will have the same peak boundaries, and different scores and peak summit positions.
        - name: broad
          label: Composite broad regions
          type: basic:boolean
          default: false
          disabled: "settings.call_summits === true"
          description: >
            When this flag is on, MACS will try to composite broad regions in BED12 ( a gene-model-like format ) by putting nearby highly enriched regions into a broad region with loose cutoff. The broad region is controlled by another cutoff through --broad-cutoff. The maximum length of broad region length is 4 times of d from MACS.
        - name: broad_cutoff
          label: Broad cutoff
          type: basic:integer
          required: false
          disabled: "settings.call_summits === true"
          description: >
            Cutoff for broad region. This option is not available unless --broad is set. If -p is set, this is a pvalue cutoff, otherwise, it's a qvalue cutoff. DEFAULT: 0.1
