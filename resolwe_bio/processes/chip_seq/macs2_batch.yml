    This process runs MACS2 in batch mode. MACS2 analysis is triggered
    for pairs of samples as defined using treatment-background sample
    relations. If there are no sample relations defined, each sample is
    treated individually for the MACS analysis.

    Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS 2.0), is used to identify
    transcript factor binding sites. MACS 2.0 captures the influence of
    genome complexity to evaluate the significance of enriched ChIP
    regions, and MACS improves the spatial resolution of binding sites
    through combining the information of both sequencing tag position
    and orientation. It has also an option to link nearby peaks together
    in order to call broad peaks. See
    [here](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/) for more information.

    In addition to peak-calling, this process computes ChIP-Seq and
    ATAC-Seq QC metrics. Process returns a QC metrics report, fragment
    length estimation, and a deduplicated tagAlign file. QC report
    contains ENCODE 3 proposed QC metrics --
    [NRF](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/),
    [PBC bottlenecking coefficients, NSC, and RSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/qualityMetrics.html#chipSeq).

            Slocal and llocal parameters control which two levels of regions will be checked
            around the peak regions to calculate the maximum lambda as local lambda. By default,
            MACS considers 1000bp for small local region (--slocal), and 10000bps for large local
            region (--llocal) which captures the bias from a long range effect like an open
            chromatin domain. You can tweak these according to your project. Remember that if the
            region is set too small, a sharp spike in the input data may kill the significant
            peak.

          description: |
            While '--nomodel' is set, MACS uses this parameter to extend reads in 5'->3' direction
            to fix-sized fragments. For example, if the size of binding region for your
            transcription factor is 200 bp, and you want to bypass the model building by MACS,
            this parameter can be set as 200. This option is only valid when --nomodel is set or
            when MACS fails to build model and --fix-bimodal is on.
        - name: shift

          required: false
          description: |
            Note, this is NOT the legacy --shiftsize option which is replaced by --extsize! You
            can set an arbitrary shift in bp here. Please Use discretion while setting it other
            than default value (0). When --nomodel is set, MACS will use this value to move
            cutting ends (5') then apply --extsize from 5' to 3' direction to extend them to
            fragments. When this value is negative, ends will be moved toward 3'->5' direction,
            otherwise 5'->3' direction. Recommended to keep it as default 0 for ChIP-Seq datasets,
            or -1 * half of EXTSIZE together with --extsize option for detecting enriched cutting
            loci such as certain DNAseI-Seq datasets. Note, you can't set values other than 0 if
            format is BAMPE for paired-end data. Default is 0.

            this parameter as the sonication fragment size expected from wet experiment. The
            previous side effect on the peak detection process has been removed. So this parameter
            only affects the model building.

          description: |
            With this flag on, MACS will use the background lambda as local lambda. This means

            Whether turn on the auto paired-peak model process. If it's set, when MACS failed
            to build paired model, it will use the nomodel settings, the '--extsize' parameter
            to extend each tags. If set, MACS will be terminated if paired-peak model is failed.

          description: |
            When set, random sampling method will scale down the bigger sample. By default, MACS
            uses linear scaling. This option will make the results unstable and irreproducible
            since each time, random reads would be selected, especially the numbers (pileup,
            pvalue, qvalue) would change. Consider to use 'randsample' script before MACS2 runs
            instead.

            If this flag is on, MACS will store the fragment pileup, control lambda, -log10pvalue
            and -log10qvalue scores in bedGraph files. The bedGraph files will be stored in
            current directory named NAME+'_treat_pileup.bdg' for treatment data,

          description: |
            MACS will now reanalyze the shape of signal profile (p or q-score depending on cutoff
            setting) to deconvolve subpeaks within each peak called from general procedure. It's
            highly recommended to detect adjacent binding events. While used, the output subpeaks
            of a big peak region will have the same peak boundaries, and different scores and peak
            summit positions.

            When this flag is on, MACS will try to composite broad regions in BED12 (a

            with loose cutoff. The broad region is controlled by another cutoff through
