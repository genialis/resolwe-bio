    featureCounts is a highly efficient general-purpose read summarization
    program that counts mapped reads for genomic features such as genes, exons,
    promoter, gene bodies, genomic bins and chromosomal locations. It can be
    used to count both RNA-seq and genomic DNA-seq reads. See the
    [official website](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/) and the
    [introductory paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/30/7/923/232889)
    for more information.

    featureCounts output includes raw counts and normalized (TPM/CPM) expression values.
    Normalized expression values are computed using rnanorm Python package under
    union-exon gene length model.

            Indicate if strand-specific read counting should be performed. For
            paired-end reads, strand of the first read is taken as the strand
            of the whole fragment. FLAG field is used to tell if a read is
            first or second read in a pair. Automated strand detection is enabled
            using the [Salmon](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library_type.html)
            tool's build-in functionality. To use this option, cDNA (transcriptome)
            index file crated using the Salmon indexing tool must be provided.
