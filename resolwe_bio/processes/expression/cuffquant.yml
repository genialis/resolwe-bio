    Cuffquant allows you to compute the gene and transcript expression
    profiles and save these profiles to files that you can analyze later with
    Cuffdiff or Cuffnorm. See
    [here](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/manual/) for more
    information.

        Provide Cufflinks with a multifasta file (genome file) via this
        option to instruct it to run a bias detection and correction
        algorithm which can significantly improve accuracy of transcript
        abundance estimates.

      label: Mask file
      type: data:annotation:gtf
      required: false
      description: |
        Ignore all reads that could have come from transcripts in this
        GTF file. We recommend including any annotated rRNA,
        mitochondrial transcripts other abundant transcripts you wish to
        ignore in your analysis in this file. Due to variable efficiency
        of mRNA enrichment methods and rRNA depletion kits, masking
        these transcripts often improves the overall robustness of
        transcript abundance estimates.

      description: |
        In cases where Cufflinks cannot determine the platform and
        protocol used to generate input reads, you can supply this
        information manually, which will allow Cufflinks to infer source
        strand information with certain protocols. The available options
        are listed below. For paired-end data, we currently only support
        protocols where reads are point towards each other:
        fr-unstranded - Reads from the left-most end of the fragment
        (in transcript coordinates) map to the transcript strand, and
        the right-most end maps to the opposite strand; fr-firststrand
        - Same as above except we enforce the rule that the right-most
        end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first
        sequenced (or only sequenced for single-end reads).
        Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated
        during first strand synthesis is sequenced; fr-secondstrand -
        Same as above except we enforce the rule that the left-most end
        of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first
        sequenced (or only sequenced for single-end reads).
        Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated
        during second strand synthesis is sequenced.

        Run an initial estimation procedure that weights reads mapping
        to multiple locations more accurately.
