    Based on `bowtie2` output (.bam file) calculate number of mapped species. Input is limited to results from
    `bowtie2` since `YT:Z:` tag used to fetch aligned species is specific to this process. Result is a count matrix
    (successfully mapped reads) where species are in rows columns contain read specifics (count, species name,
    sequence, `AS:i:` tag value).
  input:
    - name: alignment
      label: Alignment
      type: data:alignment:bam
      required: true
    - name: readlengths
      label: Species lengths threshold
      type: basic:integer
      description: |
          Species with read lengths below specified threshold will be removed from final output. Default is no removal.
