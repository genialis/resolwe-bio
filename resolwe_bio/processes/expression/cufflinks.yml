    - name: alignment
      label: Aligned reads

      label: Annotation (GTF/GFF3)

      type: data:genome:fasta
      required: false
      description: >
        Provide Cufflinks with a multifasta file (genome file) via this option to instruct it to run a bias detection and correction algorithm which can significantly improve accuracy of transcript abundance estimates.
    - name: mask_file
      label: Mask file
      type: data:annotation:gtf
      required: false
      description: >
        Ignore all reads that could have come from transcripts in this GTF file. We recommend including any annotated rRNA, mitochondrial transcripts other abundant transcripts you wish to ignore in your analysis in this file. Due to variable efficiency of mRNA enrichment methods and rRNA depletion kits, masking these transcripts often improves the overall robustness of transcript abundance estimates.

      description: >
        In cases where Cufflinks cannot determine the platform and protocol used to generate input reads, you can supply this information manually, which will allow Cufflinks to infer source strand information with certain protocols. The available options are listed below. For paired-end data, we currently only support protocols where reads are point towards each other: fr-unstranded - Reads from the left-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) map to the transcript strand, and the right-most end maps to the opposite strand; fr-firststrand - Same as above except we enforce the rule that the right-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first sequenced (or only sequenced for single-end reads). Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated during first strand synthesis is sequenced; fr-secondstrand - Same as above except we enforce the rule that the left-most end of the fragment (in transcript coordinates) is the first sequenced (or only sequenced for single-end reads). Equivalently, it is assumed that only the strand generated during second strand synthesis is sequenced.
      default: fr-unstranded
      choices:
        - label: fr-unstranded
          value: fr-unstranded
        - label: fr-firststrand
          value: fr-firststrand
        - label: fr-secondstrand
          value: fr-secondstrand
    - name: annotation_usage
      label: Instruct Cufflinks how to use the provided annotation (GFF/GTF) file
      type: basic:string
      description: >
        GTF-guide - tells Cufflinks to use the supplied reference annotation (GFF) to guide RABT assembly. Reference transcripts will be tiled with faux-reads to provide additional information in assembly. Output will include all reference transcripts as well as any novel genes and isoforms that are assembled. --GTF - tells Cufflinks to use the supplied reference annotation (a GFF file) to estimate isoform expression. It will not assemble novel transcripts, and the program will ignore alignments not structurally compatible with any reference transcript.
      default: --GTF-guide
      choices:
        - label: Use supplied reference annotation to guide RABT assembly (--GTF-guide)
          value: --GTF-guide
        - label: Use supplied reference annotation to estimate isoform expression (--GTF)
          value: --GTF
    - name: multi_read_correct
      label: Do initial estimation procedure to more accurately weight reads with multiple genome mappings
      type: basic:boolean
      default: false
      description: >
        Run an initial estimation procedure that weights reads mapping to multiple locations more accurately.
    - name: threads
      label: Use this many processor threads
      type: basic:integer
      default: 1
      description: >
        Use this many threads to align reads. The default is 1.
