    This WGBS pipeline is comprised of alignment, computation of
    methylation levels, identification of hypo-methylated regions (HMRs) and
    additional QC steps.

    First, reads are aligned by __WALT__ aligner. [WALT (Wildcard ALignment
    Tool)](https://github.com/smithlabcode/walt) is fast and accurate read
    mapping for bisulfite sequencing. Then, methylation level at each genomic
    cytosine is calculated using __methcounts__. Finally, hypo-methylated
    regions are identified using __hmr__. Both methcounts and hmr are part of
    [MethPipe](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/methpipe/) package.

    QC steps are based on [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/)
    and include high level metrics about the alignment, WGS performance and
    summary statistics from bisulfite sequencing. Final QC reports are
    summarized by MultiQC.

            Generate mean, standard deviation and plots by trimming
            the data down to MEDIAN + DEVIATIONS*MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION.
            This is done because insert size data typically includes enough
            anomalous values from chimeras and other artifacts to make the
            mean and standard deviation grossly misleading regarding the real
            distribution.
