            Slocal and llocal parameters control which two levels of regions will be checked
            around the peak regions to calculate the maximum lambda as local lambda. By default,
            MACS considers 1000 bp for small local region (--slocal), and 10000 bp for large local
            region (--llocal) which captures the bias from a long range effect like an open
            chromatin domain. You can tweak these according to your project. Remember that if the
            region is set too small, a sharp spike in the input data may kill the significant
            peak.

          description: |
            While '--nomodel' is set, MACS uses this parameter to extend reads in 5'->3' direction
            to fix-sized fragments. For example, if the size of binding region for your
            transcription factor is 200 bp, and you want to bypass the model building by MACS,
            this parameter can be set as 200. This option is only valid when --nomodel is set or
            when MACS fails to build model and --fix-bimodal is on.

          description: |
            Note, this is NOT the legacy --shiftsize option which is replaced by --extsize! You
            can set an arbitrary shift in bp here. Please Use discretion while setting it other
            than default value (0). When --nomodel is set, MACS will use this value to move
            cutting ends (5') then apply --extsize from 5' to 3' direction to extend them to
            fragments. When this value is negative, ends will be moved toward 3'->5' direction,
            otherwise 5'->3' direction. Recommended to keep it as default 0 for ChIP-Seq datasets,
            or -1 * half of EXTSIZE together with --extsize option for detecting enriched cutting
            loci such as certain DNAseI-Seq datasets. Note, you can't set values other than 0 if
            format is BAMPE for paired-end data. Default is 0.

            MACS will now reanalyze the shape of signal profile (p or q-score depending on cutoff
            setting) to deconvolve subpeaks within each peak called from general procedure. It's
            highly recommended to detect adjacent binding events. While used, the output subpeaks

            this parameter can be set as 200. This option is only valid when --nomodel is set or

            can set an arbitrary shift in bp here. Please Use discretion while setting it other
            than default value (0). When --nomodel is set, MACS will use this value to move
            cutting ends (5') then apply --extsize from 5' to 3' direction to extend them to
            fragments. When this value is negative, ends will be moved toward 3'->5' direction,
            otherwise 5'->3' direction. Recommended to keep it as default 0 for ChIP-Seq datasets,
            or -1 * half of EXTSIZE together with --extsize option for detecting enriched cutting
            loci such as certain DNAseI-Seq datasets. Note, you can't set values other than 0 if
