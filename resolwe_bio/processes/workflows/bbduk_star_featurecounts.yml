  description: |
    This RNA-seq pipeline is comprised of three steps preprocessing, alignment,
    and quantification.

    First, reads are preprocessed by __BBDuk__ which removes adapters, trims
    reads for quality from the 3'-end, and discards reads that are too short
    after trimming. Compared to similar tools, BBDuk is regarded for its
    computational efficiency.  Next, preprocessed reads are aligned by __STAR__
    aligner. At the time of implementation, STAR is considered a
    state-of-the-art tool that consistently produces accurate results from
    diverse sets of reads, and performs well even with default settings. For
    more information see [this comparison of RNA-seq
    aligners](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5792058/). Finally,
    aligned reads are summarized to genes by __featureCounts__. Gaining wide
    adoption among the bioinformatics community, featureCounts yields
    expressions in a computationally efficient manner. All three tools in
    this workflow support parallelization to accelerate the analysis.

            For unstranded RNA-seq data, Cufflinks/Cuffdiff require spliced alignments with XS strand attribute, which STAR will generate with --outSAMstrandField intronMotif option. As required, the XS strand attribute will be generated for all alignments that contain splice junctions. The spliced alignments that have undefined strand (i.e. containing only non-canonical unannotated junctions) will be suppressed. If you have stranded RNA-seq data, you do not need to use any specific STAR options. Instead, you need to run Cufflinks with the library option --library-type options. For example, cufflinks --library-type fr-firststrand should be used for the standard dUTP protocol, including Illumina's stranded Tru-Seq. This option has to be used only for Cufflinks runs and not for STAR runs.

                To switch on detection of chimeric (fusion) alignments (in addition to normal mapping), --chimSegmentMin should be set to a positive value. Each chimeric alignment consists of two "segments". Each segment is non-chimeric on its own, but the segments are chimeric to each other (i.e. the segments belong to different chromosomes, or different strands, or are far from each other). Both segments may contain splice junctions, and one of the segments may contain portions of both mates. --chimSegmentMin parameter controls the minimum mapped length of the two segments that is allowed. For example, if you have 2x75 reads and used --chimSegmentMin 20, a chimeric alignment with 130b on one chromosome and 20b on the other will be output, while 135 + 15 won't be.

  description: |
    This RNA-seq pipeline is comprised of three steps preprocessing, alignment,
    and quantification.

    First, reads are preprocessed by __BBDuk__ which removes adapters, trims
    reads for quality from the 3'-end, and discards reads that are too short
    after trimming. Compared to similar tools, BBDuk is regarded for its
    computational efficiency.  Next, preprocessed reads are aligned by __STAR__
    aligner. At the time of implementation, STAR is considered a
    state-of-the-art tool that consistently produces accurate results from
    diverse sets of reads, and performs well even with default settings. For
    more information see [this comparison of RNA-seq
    aligners](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5792058/). Finally,
    aligned reads are summarized to genes by __featureCounts__. Gaining wide
    adoption among the bioinformatics community, featureCounts yields
    expressions in a computationally efficient manner. All three tools in
    this workflow support parallelization to accelerate the analysis.

            For unstranded RNA-seq data, Cufflinks/Cuffdiff require spliced alignments with XS strand attribute, which STAR will generate with --outSAMstrandField intronMotif option. As required, the XS strand attribute will be generated for all alignments that contain splice junctions. The spliced alignments that have undefined strand (i.e. containing only non-canonical unannotated junctions) will be suppressed. If you have stranded RNA-seq data, you do not need to use any specific STAR options. Instead, you need to run Cufflinks with the library option --library-type options. For example, cufflinks --library-type fr-firststrand should be used for the standard dUTP protocol, including Illumina's stranded Tru-Seq. This option has to be used only for Cufflinks runs and not for STAR runs.

                To switch on detection of chimeric (fusion) alignments (in addition to normal mapping), --chimSegmentMin should be set to a positive value. Each chimeric alignment consists of two "segments". Each segment is non-chimeric on its own, but the segments are chimeric to each other (i.e. the segments belong to different chromosomes, or different strands, or are far from each other). Both segments may contain splice junctions, and one of the segments may contain portions of both mates. --chimSegmentMin parameter controls the minimum mapped length of the two segments that is allowed. For example, if you have 2x75 reads and used --chimSegmentMin 20, a chimeric alignment with 130b on one chromosome and 20b on the other will be output, while 135 + 15 won't be.

            GTF/GFF3 attribute to be used as feature ID. Several GTF/GFF3 lines
            with the same feature ID are considered as parts of the same
            feature. The feature ID is used to identify the counts in the
            output table. In GTF files this is usually 'gene_id', in GFF3 files
            this is often 'ID', and 'transcript_id' is frequently a valid
            choice for both annotation formats.
