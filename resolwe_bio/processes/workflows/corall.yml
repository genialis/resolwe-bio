    RNA-seq pipeline optimized for the Lexogen Corall Total RNA-Seq
    Library Prep Kit.

    UMI-sequences are extracted from the raw reads before the reads are
    trimmed and quality filtered using Cutadapt. Preprocessed reads are
    aligned by the STAR aligner and de-duplicated using UMI-tools.
    Gene abundance estimates are reported by the featureCounts tool.

    QC operates on downsampled reads and includes alignment of input
    reads to the rRNA/globin reference sequences. The reported alignment
    rate is used to asses the rRNA/globin sequence depletion rate.

    The analysis results and QC reports are summarized by the MultiQC.
