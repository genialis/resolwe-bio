    This RNA-seq pipeline is configured to be used with the Diagenode
    CATS RNA-seq kits. It is comprised of three steps, preprocessing,
    alignment, and quantification.

    First, reads are preprocessed by cutadapt which finds and removes
    adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails and other types of unwanted
    sequence from high-throughput sequencing reads. Next, preprocessed reads
    are aligned by STAR aligner. Finally, RSEM estimates gene and
    isoform expression levels from the aligned reads.

        In strand non-specific assay a read is considered overlapping with a
        feature regardless of whether it is mapped to the same or the opposite
        strand as the feature. In strand-specific forward assay and single
        reads, the read has to be mapped to the same strand as the feature.
        For paired-end reads, the first read has to be on the same strand and
        the second read on the opposite strand. In strand-specific reverse
        assay these rules are reversed.

              To switch on detection of chimeric (fusion) alignments (in addition to normal mapping), --chimSegmentMin should be set to a positive value. Each chimeric alignment consists of two "segments". Each segment is non-chimeric on its own, but the segments are chimeric to each other (i.e. the segments belong to different chromosomes, or different strands, or are far from each other). Both segments may contain splice junctions, and one of the segments may contain portions of both mates. --chimSegmentMin parameter controls the minimum mapped length of the two segments that is allowed. For example, if you have 2x75 reads and used --chimSegmentMin 20, a chimeric alignment with 130b on one chromosome and 20b on the other will be output, while 135 + 15 won't be.
