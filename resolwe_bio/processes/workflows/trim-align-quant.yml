          type: basic:string
          description: >
            End to end: Bowtie 2 requires that the entire read align from one end to the other, without any trimming (or "soft clipping") of characters from either end.
            local: Bowtie 2 does not require that the entire read align from one end to the other. Rather, some characters may be omitted ("soft clipped") from the ends in order to achieve the greatest possible alignment score.
          default: --end-to-end
          choices:
          - label: end to end mode
            value: --end-to-end
          - label: local
            value: --local

          label: Number of mismatches allowed in seed alignment (N)
          type: basic:integer
          required: false
          description: >
            Sets the number of mismatches to allowed in a seed alignment during multiseed alignment. Can be set to 0 or
            1. Setting this higher makes alignment slower (often much slower) but increases sensitivity. Default: 0.
        - name: L
          label: Length of seed substrings (L)
          type: basic:integer
          required: false
          description: >
            Sets the length of the seed substrings to align during multiseed alignment. Smaller values make alignment
            slower but more sensitive. Default: the --sensitive preset is used by default for end-to-end alignment and
            --sensitive-local for local alignment. See documentation for details.

          label: Disallow gaps within positions (gbar)
          type: basic:integer

          description: >
            Disallow gaps within <int> positions of the beginning or end of the read. Default: 4.
        - name: mp
          label: Maximal and minimal mismatch penalty (mp)
          type: basic:string
          required: false
          description: >
            Sets the maximum (MX) and minimum (MN) mismatch penalties, both integers. A number less than or equal to
            MX and greater than or equal to MN is subtracted from the alignment score for each position where a read
            character aligns to a reference character, the characters do not match, and neither is an N. If
            --ignore-quals is specified, the number subtracted quals MX. Otherwise, the number subtracted is
            MN + floor((MX-MN)(MIN(Q, 40.0)/40.0)) where Q is the Phred quality value. Default for MX, MN: 6,2.

          type: basic:string
          required: false
          description: >
            Sets the read gap open (<int1>) and extend (<int2>) penalties. A read gap of length N gets a penalty of
            <int1> + N * <int2>. Default: 5,3.
        - name: rfg
          label: Set reference gap open and close penalties (rfg)
          type: basic:string
          required: false

            Sets the reference gap open (<int1>) and extend (<int2>) penalties. A reference gap of length N gets a
            penalty of <int1> + N * <int2>. Default: 5,3.
        - name: score_min

          type: basic:string
          required: false
          description: >
            Sets a function governing the minimum alignment score needed for an alignment to be considered "valid" (i.e.
            good enough to report). This is a function of read length. For instance, specifying L,0,-0.6 sets the
            minimum-score function to f(x) = 0 + -0.6 * x, where x is the read length. The default in
            --end-to-end mode is L,-0.6,-0.6 and the default in --local mode is G,20,8.
