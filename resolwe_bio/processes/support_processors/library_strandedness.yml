    This process uses the Salmon transcript quantification tool to
    automatically infer the NGS library strandedness. For more details, please
    see the Salmon

  input:
    - name: reads
      label: Sequencing reads
      type: data:reads:fastq
      description: |
        Sequencing reads in .fastq format. Both single and paired-end
        libraries are supported
    - name: read_number
      label: Number of input reads
      type: basic:integer
      default: 50000
      description: |
        Number of sequencing reads that are subsampled from each of the
        original .fastq files before library strand detection
    - name: salmon_index
      label: Transcriptome index file
      type: data:index:salmon
      description: |
        Transcriptome index file created using the Salmon indexing tool.
        cDNA (transcriptome) sequences used for index file creation must be
        derived from the same species as the input sequencing reads to
        obtain the reliable analysis results
  output:
    - name: strandedness
      label: Library strandedness type
      type: basic:string
      description: |
        The predicted library strandedness type. The codes U and IU
        indicate 'strand non-specific' library for single or paired-end
        reads, respectively. Codes SF and ISF correspond to the
        'strand-specific forward' library, for the single or paired-end
        reads, respectively. For 'strand-specific reverse' library,
        the corresponding codes are SR and ISR. For more details, please
        see the Salmon
        [documentation](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library_type.html)

        The ratio of fragments that support the predicted library
        strandedness type
