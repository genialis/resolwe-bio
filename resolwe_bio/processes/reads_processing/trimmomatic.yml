             In addition to the alignment score, palindrome mode can verify that a minimum length of adapter has been
             detected. If unspecified, this defaults to 8 bases, for historical reasons. However, since palindrome mode
             has a very low false positive rate, this can be safely reduced, even down to 1, to allow shorter adapter
             fragments to be removed. This field is optional for preforming Illuminaclip. 'Adapter sequences', 'Seed mismatches',
             'Simple clip threshold' and 'Palindrome clip threshold' are also needed in order to use this parameter.

          description: |
            After read-though has been detected by palindrome mode, and the adapter sequence removed, the reverse read
            contains the same sequence information as the forward read, albeit in reverse complement. For this reason,
            the default behaviour is to entirely drop the reverse read.By specifying this parameter, the reverse read
            will also be retained, which may be useful e.g. if the downstream tools cannot handle a combination of paired
