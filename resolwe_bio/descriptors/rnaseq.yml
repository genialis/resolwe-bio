          value: 'yes'
        - label: Strand-specific reverse
          value: reverse
      description: >
        In strand non-specific assay a read is considered overlapping with a
        feature regardless of whether it is mapped to the same or the opposite
        strand as the feature. In strand-specific forward assay and single
        reads, the read has to be mapped to the same strand as the feature.
        For paired-end reads, the first read has to be on the same strand and
        the second read on the opposite strand. In strand-specific reverse
        assay these rules are reversed.
