# Base Docker images

The `ubuntu-16.04` and `ubuntu-18.04` images are based on
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-16.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/) and
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-18.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/)
respectively.

These base images should be used for writing any new processes that are
considered for inclusion into Resolwe Bio.
