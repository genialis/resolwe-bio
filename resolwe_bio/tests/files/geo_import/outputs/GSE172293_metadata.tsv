Mock	GSM5252013	Mock	GSM5252013	Public on Apr 21 2021	Apr 19 2021	Apr 23 2021	RNA	1	Mock	Homo sapiens	9606	dendritic cells	Mock	total RNA	RNA extraction by Trizol. RNA purity was checked by optical density of NanoDrop ND-1000 and agarose electrophoresis with the result of A260/A280≧1.8, no gDNA contamination. RNA integrity was measured by Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Assay (RIN≧7).	biotin	Single-stranded cDNA was generated from the amplified cRNA with the WT Plus cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix) and then fragmented and labeled with the WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix).	Samples were hybridized with GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix) and scanned at the NHRI Microarray Core Facility.	Array scanning was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Affymetrix)	The data were analyzed using Affymetrix Expression Console™ Software (version 1.4) default analysis settings and RMA (Robust Multi-Array) summarization and normalization options.
